# [Gergo! By g Heavy Industries](http://gboards.ca)

This is my custom layout for the Gergo keyboard.

Major changes to the default keymap:

1. Removed all mouse control from the keyboard, and adds typical WASD to Up/Down/Left/Right functionality

## Settings

To edit various settings, enable the 1u trackball and whatnot please modify /keyboards/gergo/keymaps/default/rules.mk

Ideally you should copy this directory and make your changes there. If you come up with a good layout submit a PR!
